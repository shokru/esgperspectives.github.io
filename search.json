However, green labels means guarantee ex-post ESG performance fund portfolios (S. Kim Yoon (2020)).

One reason , Davis Lescott (2019) argue, things equal, firm lower ESG scores riskier cash flows, pushes cost capital . Indeed, stockholders view ESG-driven firms resilient (Roselle (2016)). \ninclination toward sustainability can elucidated social perspectives (Hoepner, Majoch, Zhou (2019)).

Relatedly, Dikolli et al.

Blitz, Swinkels, Zanten (2021) found even though sustainable investing increases green firms’ access capital, (yet) limit funding opportunities non-sustainable companies. Also, success shareholder activism may conditional favorable factors. Barko, Cremers, Renneboog (2021) document activism “likely succeed targets good ex ante ESG track record, lower ownership concentration growth.”  \nrecent trend research seems nonetheless establish effect. may direct: large shareholders command21 firm enforces sustainable choices (lower carbon emissions, development environmentally friendly products, board gender parity (see Ghosh et al.

Z. F.

Governance often key. Saeed et al. (2021) find CSR governance efficient driver reductions carbon emissions.    \nrelated stream literature pertains ownership. Shive Forster (2020) document public firms owned mutual funds lower carbon emissions. Kordsachia, Focke, Velte (2021) find sustainable institutional ownership (measured signatory status UN Principles Responsible Investment) positively associated firm’s environmental performance.\naddition, Cox, Brammer, Millington (2004), Neubaum Zahra (2006) H.-D.

Similar results derived Boubaker et al. (2017), Starks, Venkat, Zhu (2020), J.-B.

Blitz Swinkels (2020) contend excluding unsustainable stocks portfolios contribute making world better place corresponding firms owned investors care ESG issues (thus bend corporate policy towards sustainable objectives). One example detailed Fu, Lin, Zhang (2020), shown ESG-driven shareholders can impact gaming industry. Also, ESG concerns must shared shareholders top management. latter supportive ESG policies former push, firms may negatively impacted negative incidents (Yazhou , Kahraman, Lowry (2020)), latter taken account analysts update earnings forecast (Derrien et al.
