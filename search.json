However, green labels means guarantee ex-post ESG performance fund portfolios (S. Kim Yoon (2020)). One reason may even CEOs incentivized toward sustainable goals, reaching goals may take time (Derchi, Zoni, Dossi (2021)).  \nAnother reason institutions turn SRI comes customers stakeholders (Majoch, Hoepner, Hebb (2017)).

Indeed, climate change risks (see Chapter 6), investors anticipate regulatory constraints favor environment, negatively impact polluting firms (Ramelli, Ossola, Rancan (2020)). One example carbon tax can quite costly industries (Bertolotti Kent (2019), Carattini Sen (2019)). Since green investors ask less return firms make efforts toward sustainability, SRI found negatively related cost equity (M. P. Sharfman Fernando (2008), El Ghoul et al.

Likewise, Stotz (2021) finds discount rates high-ESG stocks fallen relative low-ESG stocks, high ESG stocks higher realized returns, lower expected returns. One reason , Davis Lescott (2019) argue, things equal, firm lower ESG scores riskier cash flows, pushes cost capital . Indeed, stockholders view ESG-driven firms resilient (Roselle (2016)). \ninclination toward sustainability can elucidated social perspectives (Hoepner, Majoch, Zhou (2019)).

Typically, Democrats hold sin stocks smaller proportions, compared Republicans (H. Hong Kostovetsky (2012)), Republican shareholders related firms lower environmental performance (. Kim, Ryou, Yang (2020)).16 Investors view CSR beneficial society naturally tend favor ESG firms (Arnold et al. (2020)). Local pollution also found driver investors’ preference: Huynh, Li, Xia (2021) find managers live polluted areas tend underweight firms high emissions portfolios. \nReligiosity also seems positively correlated propensity invest sustainable companies (John Bae, Sun, Zheng (2019)), propensity toward ESG disclosure (see study Terzani Turzo (2021) operates country level Muñoz (2021b) discussion sin sectors). mutual funds even dedicated religion-based SRI (see Stultz (2020)).
